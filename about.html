            <h2>About Me</h2>
            I'm Federico Menozzi, a technology enthusiast and proponent of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and
            Open Source Software (FOSS)</a>. I enjoy programming, software engineering,
            systems administration, game development, electronics design, 3D printing, and
            anything that allows me to be creative and solve real problems. I am a tinkerer
            and a lifelong learner, and I'm always looking to expand my toolbelt and learn
            new things; after all, <a href="https://www.elise.com/quotes/heinlein_-_specialization_is_for_insects">
            specialization is for insects</a>.
            <p>
            Besides my day job as a technologist, I also enjoy other aspects of the human
            experience. I like playing musical instruments, cooking nice meals at home, and
            the occasional jaunt in the outside world.

            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            This site is a collection of information about me and some of my thoughts on a
            variety of topics. It was handwritten in plain HTML + CSS, with no JavaScript or
            analytics of any kind, and uses the <a href="https://www.nordtheme.com/">Nord</a>
            theme. My friends <a href="https://github.com/onsmith">Aaron</a> and
            <a href="https://github.com/carly-kins/">Carly</a> helped me out with the styling.
            <p>

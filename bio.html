                I am comfortable working with systems programming languages, data
                pipelines, and other backend technologies. I have experience in
                programming in C, C++, Rust, Go, Java, and Python. I also have
                experience in other essential software engineering technologies
                including SQL-based databases, version control systems (git, perforce,
                mercurial), and various unit and integration testing frameworks and
                methodologies.
                <p>
                I have also dabbled in digital hardware technologies in my spare
                time, using various microcontrollers (tinyAVR, megaAVR, ESP32,
                Xiao SAMD21, etc.) programmed using the Arduino CLI and interfacing
                with a wide variety of sensor and motor systems. I also have
                experience in designing printed circuit boards and having them
                fabricated using third-party services such as JLCPCB.

                            I worked at Google as a Software Engineer in Mountain View from August 2017 to February 2023. I worked on various projects across Google Search, Stadia (RIP), and YouTube, mostly in backend infrastructure.

                            I worked at Google as a Software Engineering Intern from May 2016 to August 2016. There, I worked on the <a href="https://skia.org">Skia</a> graphics engine, where I developed modern C++ code to emit GLSL shaders that render gradients with hard stop boundaries on the GPU more accurately and efficiently. As a result, over half of all hard stop gradients now render accurately with no loss in performance on all platforms that utilize Skia for 2D rendering (Chrome, Android, Firefox, etc.).

I worked on implementing a POSIX-compliant FUSE filesystem interface for Openstack Swift object storage in C and C++. I also travelled to IBM's HQ in Armonk, NY to pitch the project to senior executives.

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                A while back, I was in San Francisco with my then-girlfriend for
                her Ph.D exit talk. I brought with me my trusty Thinkpad T430 that
                I've had since starting college in 2012. During my time as an
                undergraduate I had replaced the stock HDD with a much faster SSD,
                upgraded the RAM from the stock 4GB to 8GB, and switched to running
                Linux full-time. This laptop has served me well ever since, serving
                as my main machine for two computer science degrees, as well as
                my personal laptop afterwards (albeit somewhat underutilized due
                to having a work laptop for most of that time).
                </p>

                <p>
                In the months leading up to this trip, I had noticed an issue with
                my laptop's left lid hinge that prevented the laptop from fully
                closing without partially separating the lid's plastic frame from
                the front bezel. I realized later that the support that connects
                the hinge to the lid's frame had broken, detaching from the hinge
                itself. This didn't affect the actual display so I mostly just
                dealt with it, resorting to banging the pieces back together with
                my fist after closing the lid in order to get everything flush
                again. This is a ThinkPad, after all; it can take a beating or
                two.
                </p>

                <p>
                Because my girlfriend was busy preparing for her exit talk during
                the day, I found myself with lots of time to walk around the city.
                On one such walk I came upon a local computer repair store and
                decided to ask how much it would cost to repair my laptop. Imagine
                my surprise when I was told that it would cost over $200 plus the
                cost of replacement parts. The owner then turned his screen around
                to show me the parts in question, revealing that it was a $30 Amazon
                listing. That was the moment when I realized "I could definitely
                just do this myself". So I set out to do just that.
                </p>

                <h2>The Repair</h2>
                <p>
                After ordering the replacement lid and hinges off of Amazon, I
                checked YouTube for tutorials and
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LbtouDvjZI">found one</a>
                that perfectly applied to my situation, as the showcased damage
                to the laptop was identical to my own situation. Performing the
                repair involved:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Removing the front bezel</li>
                    <li>Removing the keyboard, cover, and trackpad assembly</li>
                    <li>Removing the wires around the edge of the screen, as
                        well as the webcam assembly</li>
                </ul>

                after which the hinge itself could be replaced, and the steps
                above undone in reverse order.

                <p>
                None of the process required any tools other than a screwdriver,
                and all the various pieces and panels clipped back into place
                without the need to glue anything in. I consider myself quite
                fortunate in this regard; many modern laptops suffer from an
                overuse of glue, components soldered directly onto the main
                board, and other obstacles that make disassembly and repair
                difficult or even outright impossible.
                </p>

                <h2>Up Next: Battery</h2>

                <p>
                By all accounts, the ThinkPad repair was a resounding success.
                I had successfully replaced the hinge for much less money than
                if I had taken it to a shop, and had learned a thing or two
                along the way as an added bonus. The rush when I clipped the last
                piece into place and realized I could finally open and close the
                lid properly was intoxicating, similar to the dopamine hit of
                buying a nice new product, except even better because it was an
                old product that I had made to feel new again by my own hand.
                </p>

                <p>
                So I immediately set my sights on another repair that I had been
                dying to perform for some time now: replacing the aging battery.
                I was still rocking the original OEM 6-cell battery that came
                with the laptop back when I got it in 2012. In the decade of use
                since then, it had degraded significantly, and combined with my
                use of Linux (not exactly known for for its power efficiency), I
                struggled to get more than about 45 minutes of light use out of
                it, forcing me to keep it plugged in at all times.
                </p>

                <p>
                While I had hoped that replacing the battery would be as simple
                as popping the back cover and swapping in a new one, there were
                a couple of thorny details I uncovered during my research:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lenovo utilizes a battery whitelist in their battery
                        management system, so the use of non-OEM batteries would
                        require either flashing the embedded controller firmware
                        with an alternative that would skip battery authentication
                        checks, or buying third-party batteries that successfully
                        trick such checks into accepting them
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lenovo no longer produces official batteries for this
                        product line
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                This means that I would be forced to buy an aftermarket battery
                of questionable quality, and I would have to find one that had
                successfully reverse-engineered the OEM battery enough to be
                recognized as legitimate by the embedded firmware controller.
                After some deliberation I finally decided that this was too much
                uncertainty and that I would be better off finally replacing my
                laptop.
                </p>

                <h2>Dawn of the Framework Era</h2>

                <p>
                I did not make the decision to buy a new laptop lightly. Consumer
                electronics contribute an enormous amount of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste">e-waste</a>
                to landfills, polluting our environment with toxic metals and
                wasting precious nonrenewable resources. Rampant consumerism
                only accelerates this process, and one of the best ways we can
                slow the growth of e-waste is by using our electronics for as
                long as possible. I had tried to make my old ThinkPad last as
                long as possible, and as a result of my ability to open it up and
                replace some parts, I was able to stretch its lifetime to over
                a decade. Nevertheless, I decided it was finally time to invest
                in a new machine.
                </p>

                <p>
                My experience with repairing my ThinkPad greatly influenced my
                priorities in selecting a new machine. Namely, I should have
                full control over both the hardware and the software, allowing
                me to use my machine as a tool as I see fit, rather than being
                subject to artificial limitations in repairability and extensibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                I quickly settled on the
                <a href="https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-amd/">Framework 13 AMD Ryzen 7040</a>,
                as it checked all the right boxes for me:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fully repairable, with virtually all hardware being replaceable</li>
                    <li>Excellent Linux support</li>
                    <li>Open-source embedded controller firmware</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                I also opted for the DIY edition that requires assembling the
                laptop, not just because it was cheaper but because it would
                give me a feel for just how repairable this laptop actually was.
                When it finally arrived and I
                <a href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Framework+Laptop+13+(AMD+Ryzen%E2%84%A2+7040+Series)+DIY+Edition+Quick+Start+Guide/211">started assembling it</a>,
                I was blown away by just how easy it was to get parts into and
                out of this machine. Framework made several conscious decisions
                to make repair much easier than is typical, including but not
                limited to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Using captive screws throughout</li>
                    <li>Making liberal use of magnets to clamp and align panels</li>
                    <li>Adding a finger wrap on the touchpad cable to ease installation</li>
                    <li>Adding high-quality labels (with QR codes) to every major component and slot</li>
                    <li>Including a combined screwdriver/spudger tool in the box</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                I could access and replace any internal component in a matter of
                minutes. For repairs that would require more advanced soldering
                work, Framework makes full schematics and assembly drawings
                <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/availability-of-schematics-and-boardviews-BJMZ6EAu">available to repair shops</a>.
                In addition, much of the Framework software stack is
                <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer">open-source</a>,
                including their embedded controller firmware, which should help
                prevent any software lock issues around replacing the battery in
                the future.
                </p>

                <h2>The Importance of Fixing Your Own Stuff</h2>

                <p>
                My experience throughout this process, while enlightening and
                empowering, is far from typical in the consumer electronics
                space. Corporations have discovered that they can extract more
                profit from their customers through a variety of increasingly
                shady means, including but not limited to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Designing products to be more difficult to upgrade, such
                        as by soldering upgradable components like RAM and
                        storage directly to a computer's mainboard, or by using
                        industrial adhesives to glue components like batteries
                        into place
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designing products with an artificially-low expected
                        operating lifespan, often coinciding with the end of
                        the manufacturer's warranty support (i.e.
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">planned obsolescence</a>)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Restricting access to first-party parts, tools, and
                        documentation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using software locks and device pairing to prevent the
                        use of third-party parts that would otherwise work just
                        fine
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Requiring the use of the cloud for some devices to operate,
                        and then shutting down the servers after a few years,
                        leaving you with little more than a paper weight
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                There are countless examples of such practices happening in the
                real world:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Apple has historically been notorious for manufacturing
                        laptops that make heavy use of soldered-on components
                        and adhesives, preventing common upgrades such as adding
                        more memory or storage, and instead forcing you to bring
                        your laptop to an Apple store (or even to buy a new one
                        entirely)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        HP printers would display fake error messages when users
                        attempted to use third-party ink cartridges
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        John Deere tractors enter a slow "limp" mode when some
                        errors show up, forcing users to hire a John Deere
                        technician to clear them out using special software
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                However, there is hope on the horizon. For example, Apple now
                has a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/">self-service repair program</a>
                that allows customers access to specialized tools for repairing
                their phones and laptops (though they still have yet to do away
                with parts pairing). The FTC has recently <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-states-sue-deere-company-protect-farmers-unfair-corporate-tactics-high-repair-costs">sued John Deere</a>
                for monopolistic practices that drive up the time and cost of
                tractor repair. And companies like Framework have shown that it
                is possible to design and sell products with repairability in
                mind.
                </p>

                <p>
                Ultimately, consumers will need to shift their perspective when
                it comes to their relationships with their products and their
                consumerist habits in general. We need to ensure that we utilize
                our products to their fullest extent, and become more comfortable
                with the idea of repairing what we already own, rather than
                defaulting to simply buying a new one. This in turn requires that
                the products themselves are designed to last and work for the
                user, and that we be in control of our technology and not the
                other way around. In our current capitalist system, that means
                voting with our wallets for products that we can truly own and
                that won't let us down with artificial limitations. Additionally,
                we should support legislation for enshrining the right to repair
                into law.
                </p>

                <p>
                Several months in, my new Framework has been an absolute pleasure
                to use. It has excellent Linux support and I get several hours
                of battery life on a single charge. My hope is to use this for
                at <strong>least</strong> another decade, upgrading parts as
                needed along the way, turning it into my own little

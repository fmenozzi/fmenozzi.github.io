                The Unix philosophy describes a mindset for creating software tools that do one
                thing well and work harmoniously with one another. It eschews monolithic designs
                in favor of small, self-contained utilities that are easily composable, allowing
                for great computational flexibility. It originated with Ken Thompson and his
                colleagues at Bell Labs and is based on their experience writing the Unix
                operating system. In their seminal work <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unix-Programming-Environment-Prentice-Hall-Software/dp/013937681X">
                <i>The UNIX Programming Environment</i></a>, Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike describe
                it as follows:

                <blockquote>
                <i>
                    "Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence, at its heart
                    is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among
                    programs than from the programs themselves. Many Unix programs do trivial things
                    in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools."
                </i>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                Many of the ideas of the Unix philosophy stem from practical considerations of the
                time: programs had to be small and self-contained due to extreme resource constraints
                in hardware. Interfaces were often limited to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter">
                physical teletype machines</a> that operated in simple text streams, and computers were
                often shared resources that had to serve multiple users, further limiting resource availability.
                In such an environment, extraneous features and bloated monoliths were often not practical.
                </p>

                <h2>Core Tenets</h2>

                The Unix philosophy can be summarized by the following core tenets:
                <ol>
                    <li>Programs should do one thing and do it well</li>
                    <li>Programs should be designed to work well together</li>
                    <li>Programs should handle plain text streams</li>
                    <li>Everything* is a file</li>
                </ol>
                *<i>in practice this is not quite always true</i>

                <p>
                Let's break these down individually.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Programs should do one thing and do it well</h3>

                As mentioned at the start, the Unix philosophy rejects monolithic programs that
                try to do everything, opting instead for a large number of small programs that
                each do one specific task. Such programs are often called software tools, drawing
                comparisons to physical tools that excel at performing a single task; after all,
                hammers are excellent for driving nails but terrible for driving screws, and combining
                a hammer and a screwdriver will result in a tool that is well-suited for neither task.
                Software designed to perform a single task has the added benefit of being much
                easier to debug and maintain, which increases longevity.

                <h3>2. Programs should be designed to work well together</h3>

                In order for the true power of the Unix philosophy to shine, it is not sufficient
                that programs be simple and single-minded, as real-world computing tasks often
                require more than what any individual such program can achieve. It is therefore
                imperative that these programs compose harmoniously in order to achieve ad hoc
                computation. In most Unix environments this is best exemplified by the use of
                the <i>pipe</i> <code>|</code> that allows for the output of one program to be
                seamlessly passed as the input to another, but more generally it means conforming
                to common interfaces like plain text streams and files to ensure maximal interoperability.

                <h3>3. Programs should handle plain text streams</h3>

                The early Unix pioneers described text streams as the universal interface, and
                elected to use plain text for nearly all data and file formats. This has a
                number of benefits over binary or proprietary formats:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Plain text is <i>simple</i>, which means it's easier to write programs
                        to use it effectively
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Plain text is <i>human-readable</i>, which can make a big difference if
                        you need to e.g. inspect the output of an intermediate command while
                        debugging a long chain of piped programs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Plain text is <i>portable</i>, which means that your programs are much
                        more likely to work on other architectures or operating systems with
                        fewer modifications
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Everything is a file</h3>

                When people say that everything is a file in Unix, what they really mean is that
                everything has a file-like interface in Unix. This allows for vastly simplified
                interfaces to programs, allowing them to remain small and focused: Unix programs
                often only accept data through stdin or via files. These same programs can then
                be used to read/write data from/to phyiscal devices, over networks, etc.

                Examples of Unix file interfaces include:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Devices</strong>: block devices (e.g. hard drives) and character
                        devices (e.g. serial output from a microcontroller)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Network sockets</strong>: TCP/UDP sockets allow inter-process
                        communication (IPC) between two remote hosts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Processes</strong>: the <code>/proc/</code> filesystem exposes
                        files and directories for every running process in the system, allowing
                        systems to be queried live using simple file-based tools
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Named pipes</strong>: similar to regular <code>|</code> pipes,
                        named pipes allow for local IPC between processes, though named pipes
                        can outlive the processes in question
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Unix shells have excellent support for handling files and file-like interfaces.
                For example, most shells allow for <i>redirection</i> of input and output using
                <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>, respectively. This allows using file contents
                as inputs/outputs, and because everything in Unix is a file, this can be quite
                powerful. You can even wrap arbitrary command output in a file-like interface via
                <i>process substitution</i>, like this Bash example:

<div class="code-block">
<pre>
<code>diff &lt;(ls dir1) &lt;(ls dir2)</code>
</pre>
</div>

                In this example, we use the <code>&lt;()</code> syntax to wrap the result of each
                <code>ls</code> command as though it were a file, and pass these two "files" to
                <code>diff</code> for comparison. The result is that we can compare two directories
                to see if they contain the same files by name at their top level.

                <h2>Motivating Examples</h2>

                People who are not accustomed to the Unix philosophy will reject it unless they
                can understand its power. This section will therefore offer some motivating
                examples to demonstrate how the Unix philosophy can be used to solve practical
                everyday problems. Each of the tasks will be completed using the following limited
                set of basic <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html">GNU coreutils</a>
                programs:

                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>find</code>: find files by name and type</li>
                    <li><code>grep</code>: search file contents</li>
                    <li><code>cd</code>: change directories</li>
                    <li><code>head</code>: output first <i>n</i> lines of file</li>
                    <li><code>diff</code>: compare files line by line</li>
                    <li><code>du</code>: determine disk usage of file</li>
                    <li><code>sort</code>: sort lines in file</li>
                    <li><code>uniq</code>: report or omit duplicate lines in file</li>
                    <li><code>xargs</code>: run commands for every item in stdin</li>
                    <li><code>ps</code>: get information on currently-running processes</li>
                    <li><code>md5sum</code>: hash file contents
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Note that MD5 is <strong>not</strong> suited for cryptography and
                                is easily defeated by modern commodity hardware. However, using it
                                for hashing local files to compare them for equality is fine.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Display the top ten memory-consuming processes</h3>

<div class="code-block">
<pre>
<code>ps aux | sort -b -r -k 4 | head</code>
</pre>
</div>

                Here we use <code>ps</code> to list all processes (<code>a</code>) including those running
                in the background (<code>x</code>) and display additional information like CPU and memory
                usage (<code>u</code>). We then sort this list lexicographically (<code>sort</code>) ignoring
                leading blanks (<code>-b</code>) in reverse order (<code>-r</code>) by memory usage corresponding
                to the fourth column in each line (<code>-k 4</code>). We finally send this sorted list to
                <code>head</code> to get the first ten lines, the default number of lines used by <code>head</code>.

                <h3>Find duplicate files (by contents) in current directory</h3>

<div class="code-block">
<pre>
<code>find . -type f | xargs -d "\n" md5sum | sort | uniq -w 32 -D</code>
</pre>
</div>

                First we get a list of all files in the current directory (<code>find . -type f</code>),
                then we apply the MD5 hash to each newline-delimitted file in the list (<code>xargs -d "\n" md5sum</code>)
                and sort the resulting list of hashes followed by filenames lexicographically (<code>sort</code>).
                We then print the unique entires in this list (<code>uniq</code>) by comparing based on the
                first 32 characters representing the MD5 hash (<code>-w 32</code>) and printing all the duplicate
                lines (<code>-D</code>).

                <h3>Find the five largest files in your home directory</h3>

<div class="code-block">
<pre>
<code>find ~ -type f | xargs -d "\n" du -h | sort -h -r -k 1 | head -n 5</code>
</pre>
</div>

                First we get a list of all files in the home directory (<code>find ~ -type f</code>), then
                we get the disk usage of each newline-delimitted file in the list (<code>xargs -d "\n" du -h</code>).
                We pass the <code>-h</code> flag to <code>du</code> in order to output the sizes in human-readable
                form (3K, 40M, 3G, etc). We then sort this list lexicographically (<code>sort</code>) in reverse
                order (<code>-r</code>) using the first part of the line corresponding to the disk usage
                (<code>-k 1</code>) in human-readable form (<code>-h</code>) before printing the first five
                lines (<code>head -n 5</code>).

                <h3>Recursively compare two directory trees</h3>

<div class="code-block">
<pre>
<code>diff &lt;(cd dir1 &amp;&amp; find . | sort) &lt;(cd dir2 &amp;&amp; find . | sort)</code>
</pre>
</div>

                We saw an example earlier of using <code>diff</code> to compare two directories, but that example
                only compares the top-level items in each directory. This one will compare each directory structure
                recursively to determine whether they contain the same files and directories by name (not contents,
                like our previous duplicate files example).

                <p>
                Like the earlier example, we make use of process substitution to create two "files" to send to
                <code>diff</code> for comparison, where each "file" is a list of sorted (<code>sort</code>) paths
                for each file and directory present in the target directory (<code>cd dir &amp;&amp; find .</code>).
                Note that we <code>cd</code> into each target directory first in each process
                substitution command: this will prevent the target directory names from appearing in the sorted list
                of paths, which would cause every entry to be considered a diff if the two target directories have
                different names.
                </p>

                <h3>Find all five-letter English words that end in "out"</h3>

<div class="code-block">
<pre>
<code>grep ^..out$ /usr/share/dict/words</code>
</pre>
</div>

                This might only be useful for cheating at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">
                Wordle</a>, but I decided to include it as an example of a task that a user can complete locally
                that they may otherwise delegate to an online search engine. It uses
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a> to search the
                <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code> text file of English words (shipped in most Linux distributions)
                to search for patterns matching the start of a line, any two letters, "out", and then finally the
                end of a line.

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                At its heart, the Unix philosophy is about simplicity, interoperability, and separation of concerns;
                about small, simple programs that do their job well and adhere to simple and common interfaces; about
                unlocking the true potential of a system by using the myriad different combinations of utilities to
                effect arbitrary computation. It's a way of thinking about software and system design that maximizes
                flexibility and potential utility, and is as timeless as it is effective. While the original Unix itself
                may have come and gone, its legacy still prevails to this day, allowing for yesterday's programs to work
                seamlessly with today's in order to solve tomorrow's problems.
